# CptS-321
Object Oriented Design C#

# WINFORMS
First WinForms app. Takes large number of random integers, looks through and calculates the number of times every number appears (not counting a second occurence) must do this 3 different ways, one with a hashtable, one with O(1) space complexity on a sorted list, and one with no restrictions. Ends with displaying each method and result to textbox.

# NOTEPADAPP
A simple version of the NotePad app. Has two pre created files that load the first 50 and 100 integers in Fibonacci sequence. Has editable textbox and allows the user to save and load text files.

# ABSTRACT BINARY SEARCH TREE
An add-on to our first project we take a Binary search tree and allow it to work in a templated environment to handle more options than just int in the node. 

# SPREADSHEET
This is a simplified Excel program, spreadsheet information can be saved and reloaded. Allows the user to put values in cells and perform basic calculations on them. Contains a Winforms program which is the actual spreadsheet application, this also has a backend that works both as the spreadsheet backend as well as it's own console calculator app (which can be run by adjusting visual studio settings to compile as console app instead of winforms).

# THREADED MERGE SORT
Final project for this course, make two implementations of merge sort. The first will be made as a simple merge sort function, the second follows the same algorithm but uses threading on the function call. Returns time taken for each merge sort to fully sort an array of integers.
