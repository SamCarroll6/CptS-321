# WINFORMS
First WinForms app. Takes large number of random integers, looks through and calculates the number of times every number appears (not counting a second occurence) must do this 3 different ways, one with a hashtable, one with O(1) space complexity on a sorted list, and one with no restrictions. Ends with displaying each method and result to textbox.

# NOTEPADAPP
A simple version of the NotePad app. Has two pre created files that load the first 50 and 100 integers in Fibonacci sequence. Has editable textbox and allows the user to save and load text files.

# Abstract Binary Search Tree
An add on to our first project we take a Binary search tree and allow it to work in a templated environment to handle more options than just int in the node.
